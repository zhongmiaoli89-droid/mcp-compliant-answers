CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL RECORD: ASTRAGENE LABORATORIES (AGL)
I. Capital Structure & Financial Standing
Funding Stage: Series B (Completed Nov 2025).

Total Capital Raised: $112.5M USD.

Lead Investors: Vortex Ventures, GigaHealth Capital, and the Massachusetts Biotech Fund.

Valuation Methodology: Current valuation of $480M based on rNPV (risk-adjusted Net Present Value) of the Chronos-3 therapeutic pipeline.

Equity Distribution: * 40% Venture Capital Consortia.

35% Founding Team & Executive Leadership.

15% Employee Option Pool (ESOP).

10% Strategic Partner (Pfizer-BioTech Alliance).

II. Principal Investigators (PI) & Scientific Oversight
The PI is the legal and scientific steward of every AstraGene study. They are responsible for compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) mandates.

Chief PI (Genomics): Dr. Julian Sterling. Oversees the Somatic Resilience trials. Sterling has final "Stop-Trial" authority for any adverse patient reactions.

Chief PI (Synthetic Biology): Dr. Sarah Chen. Leads the Metabolic Kill-Switch program for environmental microbes.

PI Responsibilities:

Integrity: Ensuring 100% accuracy in Lab Notebooks and digital metadata.

Ethics: Supervising informed consent for all Phase I human cell trials.

Reporting: Mandatory reporting of "Significant Deviations" to the Bio-Safety Oversight Committee within 4 hours.

III. Intellectual Property (IP) Portfolio
AstraGene’s value is anchored in its Intangible Assets. We use AI-Driven IP Harvesting to protect innovations in real-time.

Patents: AstraGene holds 84 active patents and 112 pending applications.

Flagship Patent (US-2026-0045): The "Adeno-Vault" delivery mechanism for CRISPR payloads.

Trade Secrets: The specific chemical composition of Agent-X (the enzyme required for microbe survival) is classified as a "Tier-1 Trade Secret" and is never documented in external patent filings to prevent reverse-engineering.

IP Protection Policy:

Invention Disclosure: Any researcher who discovers a novel sequence must file an "Invention Disclosure Form" via the internal AI portal before presenting at any symposium.

Non-Compete: All research staff are bound by a 24-month restrictive covenant in the "Genomic Correction" sector.

IV. Core Technology & Facilities
The Chronos Array: High-throughput sequencing with a 99.9% accuracy rate.

Zone Red Protocol: Level-4 containment. Access requires a Red Badge and Tier-1 PI approval. Breach results in immediate Argon-Flood neutralization.
