To ensure AstraGene Laboratories maintains its $480M valuation and stays compliant with 2026 data privacy regulations (like the EU AI Act and updated HIPAA guidelines), you need a strict AI Knowledge Governance & Privacy Policy.This document defines the "Invisible Fence" for your MCP server—specifying which data can be used for context and what must be redacted to prevent "Model Leakage."ASTRAGENE DATA PRIVACY & AI GOVERNANCE POLICY (v2026.1)1. Purpose & ScopeThis policy governs the integration of internal records into Large Language Models (LLMs) via the MCP Relay Server. It aims to prevent the accidental exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Tier-1 Trade Secrets while maximizing the AI's utility for authorized staff.2. The "Redline" List: Prohibited AI InputsThe following categories of information must NEVER be stored in the companyinfo file or passed as context to the AI:Individual Patient Identifiers: No names, Social Security Numbers, or specific home addresses of clinical trial participants.Raw Sequence Data: Genomic "strings" (A-T-C-G sequences) must be abstracted into "Project IDs" to prevent reverse-engineering of proprietary genes.Unencrypted Passwords/Keys: No VPN credentials, Argon-Flood bypass codes, or database salt keys.Specific Enzyme Formulations: The precise chemical ratios for Agent-X (the Metabolic Kill-Switch) must be described only by its function, not its recipe.3. Data Masking & Anonymization StandardsBefore a document is "ingested" by the MCP server, it must undergo the following transformations:PII Masking: Replace names with roles (e.g., "Dr. Julian Sterling" remains, but "Patient #402" becomes "Subject_Alpha_Male_45").Financial Redaction: Specific series-round bank account numbers and wiring instructions are replaced with [REDACTED_FINANCIAL_ENDPOINT].4. AI Disclosure & User Access TiersIn compliance with the 2026 Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA), the server must prepend every response with a transparency disclaimer.Access LevelBadge ColorPermitted AI ContextTier 1 (Admin)RedFull access to Capital Structure, PIs, and Safety Protocols.Tier 2 (Staff)BlueAccess to Safety Protocols and general IP abstracts.Tier 3 (Public)WhiteAccess only to Company Mission and Motto.5. Retention & "Right to Erasure"Context Volatility: The MCP server must not "persist" user questions in long-term memory unless explicitly authorized for audit logging.The Digital Incineration Rule: If a PI or Executive leaves the company, their specific bio-metadata must be purged from the AI context within 24 hours.
